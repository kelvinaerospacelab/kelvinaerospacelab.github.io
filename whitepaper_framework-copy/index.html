<h2 id="liquid-rocket-engine-development-and-stem-education-program">Liquid Rocket Engine Development and STEM Education Program</h2>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-executive-summary">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Kelvin Aerospace Lab (KAL) is a non-profit student-led organization founded in September 2025 with a dual mission: providing hands-on engineering education through liquid rocket development, and advancing STEM accessibility in underserved communities. Unlike typical student projects working within established frameworks, we develop liquid rocket engines—requiring students to work with combustion dynamics, thermal management, control systems, and safety protocols where solutions are not predetermined.</p>
<p>Since founding, we&rsquo;ve completed computational analyses for a 200-Newton thrust engine, validated designs through ANSYS simulations, prototyped and tested pintle injectors, developed custom calculation software, and finalized test bench electronics. We operate through two pillars: Engineering Innovation develops rocket propulsion systems for educational and competition use, while Social Impact channels resources to schools lacking STEM programs—particularly Indigenous communities—through equipment donations, funding support, and open-source documentation.</p>
<p>We seek sponsorship to complete Phase 1 engine testing ($7,000), launch charitable programs serving 2-3 schools ($5,000-10,000), and establish sustainable organizational infrastructure ($3,000-5,000). This supports not just a student project, but a sustainable model producing skilled engineers, accessible STEM resources, and pathways for underrepresented communities in aerospace technology.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-vision--mission">2. VISION &amp; MISSION</h2>
<h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h3>
<p>Kelvin Aerospace Lab provides high school students with hands-on experience designing, fabricating, and testing liquid rocket propulsion systems. Students work with real propellants, real combustion, and real engineering constraints where failure teaches as much as success. We document everything—creating open-source resources, calculation tools, and design methodologies accessible to future student teams worldwide.</p>
<p>We support STEM education in under-resourced schools and community organizations. We provide equipment grants, technical mentorship, and design documentation to schools lacking these resources. Our focus on Indigenous communities and underserved districts addresses systematic barriers limiting STEM participation. A portion of future revenue funds this charitable mission, ensuring sustainability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-problem-statement--opportunity">3. PROBLEM STATEMENT &amp; OPPORTUNITY</h2>
<p>Secondary STEM education faces a critical gap: while online resources provide advanced theory, opportunities for authentic hands-on engineering have become scarce. Traditional competitions—robotics, rocketry—operate within established frameworks with defined objectives and known solutions. Students excel at problem sets but struggle with open-ended design challenges requiring interdisciplinary thinking and resilience through failure.</p>
<p>Liquid rocket engine development provides an ideal challenge. Unlike full rocket systems requiring extensive infrastructure, a static test engine is developable with manageable resources while demanding deep work across thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science, electronics, and mechanical design. Students contributing to this—whether through simulation, fabrication, or testing—demonstrate ability to manage technical uncertainty, iterate through failures, and synthesize theory with practice. The work requires rigorous safety planning, regulatory awareness, and professional documentation rarely taught in classrooms.</p>
<p>The opportunity is twofold. Educationally, schools seek accessible propulsion systems with documentation and support—our future kits address this market while funding operations. Socially, STEM inequality has direct consequences for innovation capacity. Indigenous communities and underfunded districts possess motivated students but lack equipment, mentors, and materials. Our model combines equipment donations with design files, tutorials, and remote consultation—creating lasting capability rather than one-time interventions. As AI reshapes the economy, broad-based STEM literacy becomes urgent.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-technical-approach--development-strategy">4. TECHNICAL APPROACH &amp; DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</h2>
<h3 id="philosophy-progressive-complexity-and-validated-learning">Philosophy: Progressive Complexity and Validated Learning</h3>
<p>KAL&rsquo;s engineering approach is built on a philosophy of progressive complexity validated through systematic testing. Rather than attempting to build the most ambitious system first, we follow a deliberately structured development path where each phase achieves specific technical milestones, validates core assumptions, and provides learning that informs subsequent work. This methodology mirrors professional aerospace development while remaining achievable within our resource and timeline constraints. Every design decision is documented, every simulation is verified against theory, and every prototype undergoes thorough analysis before advancing to the next phase.</p>
<p>Our development strategy emphasizes custom tool creation alongside hardware development. We recognize that aerospace engineering relies heavily on specialized software for performance prediction, system optimization, and data analysis. Rather than treating these as black boxes, we develop our own calculation tools,</p>
<p>simulation frameworks, and data acquisition systems. This serves dual purposes: it deepens student understanding of the underlying physics and mathematics, and it produces open-source resources that benefit the broader student aerospace community. Our custom rocket performance calculator, developed in Rust for computational efficiency, demonstrates this approach—students now understand not just how to use NASA CEA data, but how thermochemical calculations actually work and how to automate complex design iterations.</p>
<h3 id="current-development-status-february-2026">Current Development Status (February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our project has progressed through comprehensive planning and into detailed design and prototype validation. Over seven formal meetings from September through October 2025, we established technical roadmaps, organizational workflows, and safety protocols. We then transitioned to a progress-driven meeting structure, focusing intensive effort on engineering development. The results demonstrate substantial progress across multiple technical domains.</p>
<p>In computational analysis and simulation, we have completed full thermochemical calculations for a 200-Newton thrust engine using NASA CEA data and validated these results against Rocket Propulsion Analysis software, achieving agreement within 5% across all major performance parameters. This validation gives us confidence in our analytical methods and provides a robust foundation for hardware design. We developed custom calculation software to automate the iterative design process, allowing rapid exploration of design variations and trade-offs. ANSYS transient simulations of the nozzle geometry confirm that stress, thermal loads, and flow characteristics meet design specifications under operational pressures and temperatures.</p>
<p>Physical prototyping has focused on validating key design concepts before committing to metal fabrication. We 3D-printed a regenerative cooling channel model in PLA to understand the complex internal geometry and verify that our design is manufacturable and allows proper fluid flow paths. Water flow testing of this prototype confirmed that coolant channels function as intended without excessive pressure drop or flow restriction. Similarly, we fabricated pintle injector prototypes and conducted water spray characterization tests to observe atomization patterns and film formation. These low-cost validation tests enable us to refine designs iteratively before investing in expensive metal 3D printing.</p>
<p>Test infrastructure development has proceeded in parallel. We finalized the test bench mechanical design, including propellant storage, pressurization systems, and structural mounting. The electronics architecture is complete, specifying sensors for pressure, temperature, thrust, and mass flow, along with control solenoid valves, data acquisition hardware, and safety interlocks. We transitioned from Arduino-based prototypes to ESP32 microcontrollers to handle the increased sensor count and enable wireless telemetry. Control software development is underway, focusing on real-time data logging, automated safety responses, and remote operation capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="development-phases-from-gas-fed-to-advanced-control">Development Phases: From Gas-Fed to Advanced Control</h3>
<p>Our technical roadmap consists of distinct phases, each building upon validated results from the previous stage. This structure ensures that complexity is introduced gradually and that students gain competency in fundamental systems before tackling advanced topics.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Gas-Fed Baseline Engine (Current - Q2 2026)</strong> establishes fundamental propulsion capability using gaseous oxygen and room-temperature ethanol as propellants. This configuration deliberately avoids regenerative cooling to isolate core challenges: achieving stable combustion with our pintle injector design, validating nozzle performance under actual firing conditions, and demonstrating safe propellant feed and control systems. The test bench will be fully functional with automated data acquisition, real-time visualization, and emergency shutdown systems. Success metrics include achieving predicted thrust within 10%, stable combustion for 10-second burns, and safe, repeatable test operations. This phase is projected to require approximately six months, with completion targeted for mid-2026.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Regenerative Cooling Integration (Q3-Q4 2026)</strong> introduces thermal management systems essential for extended burn durations and higher chamber pressures. The regenerative cooling design routes ethanol propellant through passages machined into the combustion chamber walls before injection, absorbing heat that would otherwise melt the chamber. This phase requires sophisticated thermal analysis to ensure adequate cooling without excessive pressure drop, careful manufacturing to produce complex internal geometries, and extensive testing to verify that thermal loads remain within material limits. We will also optimize injector atomization based on Phase 1 results and refine chamber geometry for improved combustion efficiency. Parallel to hardware development, we will research liquid oxygen storage solutions and cryogenic handling procedures needed for Phase 3. Success here means achieving burn durations of 30+ seconds with chamber wall temperatures remaining within safe limits.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Pump-Fed System with LOX (2027)</strong> represents our transition to a flight-capable propulsion system. Replacing gaseous oxygen with liquid oxygen (LOX) dramatically increases propellant density, enabling compact tankage and higher performance. Electric pump-fed propellant supply replaces pressurized gas systems, providing precise flow control and variable thrust capability. This phase demands expertise in cryogenic fluid handling, pump selection and integration, and closed-loop control systems. Students will engage with professional cryogenic equipment suppliers, develop comprehensive safety protocols for LOX operations, and implement sophisticated control algorithms for pump speed regulation. The deliverable is a complete first-generation engine system capable of sustained operation with professional-grade performance and controllability.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 4: Advanced Control Systems (2027-2028)</strong> develops thrust vector control (TVC), throttling, and hover capability for flight applications. We will implement PID control initially, then evaluate neural network-based controllers trained in simulation. Hover control requires processing multiple sensor inputs (accelerometers, gyroscopes, thrust, propellant levels) to command TVC gimbals and throttle valves. Neural networks can be trained in simulation before hardware testing. Successful hover demonstrations would enable landing systems, hopper vehicles, and advanced education platforms.</p>
<h3 id="quality-and-documentation-standards">Quality and Documentation Standards</h3>
<p>Quality and safety are designed into every development phase. All calculations are independently verified, simulations undergo convergence studies, and hardware testing follows written procedures with documented safety reviews. Test operations require minimum safe distances, protective equipment, and emergency response protocols. We engage professional safety consultants and maintain communication with fire safety authorities.</p>
<p>Documentation is comprehensive and open-source. Every design decision, calculation, simulation, and test result is recorded on our documentation platform. GitHub hosts all software, CAD files, and technical reports. Meeting notes and progress updates are published on our website. This creates institutional knowledge persisting beyond student graduation, enables external collaboration, provides resources for other teams, and demonstrates professional standards to sponsors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-organizational-structure--management">5. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE &amp; MANAGEMENT</h2>
<h3 id="a-two-pillar-operating-model">A Two-Pillar Operating Model</h3>
<p>Kelvin Aerospace Lab operates two connected activities: engineering development and education support. Engineering work produces intellectual property, technical capability, and revenue that funds education programs. Education programs build partnerships and identify community needs. This structure ensures sustainability and allows both activities to support each other.</p>
<h3 id="pillar-one-technological-innovation-and-engineering-development">Pillar One: Technological Innovation and Engineering Development</h3>
<p>The Engineering Innovation pillar encompasses technical work on liquid rocket propulsion systems, control algorithms, test infrastructure, and educational kit development. Students conduct simulations, fabricate hardware, analyze data, and iterate through design cycles. Teams organize around functional specialties—Propulsion Analysis, CAD and Mechanical Design, Avionics and Control, Fabrication and Testing—while maintaining cross-functional communication through regular technical reviews.</p>
<p>Leadership rotates based on project phases and development needs, ensuring all students build both technical depth and project management skills. Faculty advisors and industry mentors provide technical review and safety oversight, while day-to-day engineering decisions rest with students. Comprehensive documentation—requirements, analysis, simulations, test data—creates institutional knowledge persisting across student graduation, provides resources for external teams, and demonstrates professional standards.</p>
<h3 id="pillar-two-social-impact-and-stem-education-accessibility">Pillar Two: Social Impact and STEM Education Accessibility</h3>
<p>The Social Impact pillar operates with its own structure, budget, and objectives, ensuring charitable activities receive focused attention. We identify communities facing resource barriers, develop partnerships addressing specific needs, manage equipment donations, and create educational content making aerospace accessible.</p>
<p>Outreach includes equipment grants (3D printers, CNC machines, electronics) accompanied by training materials, remote consultation, and documentation access. We target Indigenous schools and underfunded districts where resources are scarce but interest is strong. Educational content includes design tutorials, video walkthroughs, lesson plans, and open-source calculation software—democratizing aerospace knowledge while strengthening our technical work through clear articulation.</p>
<p>Funding comes from dedicated revenue streams separate from engineering operations. Sponsors can direct contributions to charitable work; future propulsion kit sales allocate a fixed percentage to this budget. Partnership management emphasizes long-term relationships—multi-year commitments with ongoing consultation, maintenance support, and pathways for exceptional students to join KAL projects directly.</p>
<h3 id="coordination-between-pillars-integration-without-compromise">Coordination Between Pillars: Integration Without Compromise</h3>
<p>The two-pillar structure deliberately separates engineering and social impact to ensure each receives focused attention, but coordination mechanisms ensure synergy. Monthly joint meetings review progress across both areas, identify opportunities for integration (for example, using engineering prototypes as demonstration hardware for school visits), and maintain alignment with overall organizational mission. Financial reports are transparent across both pillars, ensuring resources are allocated according to strategic priorities rather than bureaucratic silos. Student members participate in both engineering and outreach activities based on interest and capacity, creating cultural integration where technical excellence and social responsibility are equally valued.</p>
<p>This organizational model is deliberately designed for sustainability beyond the current founding team. Documentation practices, rotating leadership, and explicit knowledge transfer processes ensure that students graduating don&rsquo;t take critical institutional knowledge with them. We actively recruit participants from younger grades, providing them pathways to develop competency before senior members graduate. Faculty advisors and community mentors provide continuity across student cycles. Financial models based on recurring revenue rather than one-time fundraising create stable resource availability. These structural elements position KAL to operate effectively for years or decades, serving many cohorts of students and partner communities rather than existing for a single project cycle.</p>

<h2 id="6-funding-needs--sponsorship-model">6. FUNDING NEEDS &amp; SPONSORSHIP MODEL</h2>
<h3 id="why-we-need-support">Why We Need Support</h3>
<p>As a high school student organization, KAL faces resource challenges that distinguish us from university research groups or corporate R&amp;D teams. We operate without institutional budgets, recurring grant allocations, or commercial revenue streams. Yet our technical ambitions—developing a functional liquid rocket engine with regenerative cooling and advanced control systems—require real funding for components, fabrication, safety equipment, and testing infrastructure. Traditional student fundraising (bake sales, donation drives) cannot generate the capital needed for serious aerospace engineering. We need partners who understand that supporting ambitious student projects creates both educational value and potential future technology.</p>
<h3 id="current-funding-priorities">Current Funding Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Phase 1 Engine Development ($7,000)</strong><br>
Our immediate need is completing our first gas-fed engine and conducting static fire tests. This includes component procurement ($400-600), test bench infrastructure ($2,000-3,000), metal 3D-printed combustion chamber ($1,500-2,000), and safety equipment/permits (several hundred dollars). Successful Phase 1 demonstrates our technical capability and validates our engineering approach, creating momentum for subsequent phases and larger partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Charitable STEM Programs ($5,000-10,000)</strong><br>
We have identified Indigenous schools and underfunded districts interested in partnerships, but equipment donations (3D printers, CNC machines, electronics) require dedicated funding. Initial charitable programs would serve 2-3 schools, establish our impact model, and generate data supporting future funding applications. This is separate from engineering funds—sponsors can direct support specifically to education access.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Infrastructure ($3,000-5,000)</strong><br>
Formal non-profit incorporation, liability insurance, and administrative systems ensure long-term viability. While less exciting than engine testing, these investments enable multi-year operation serving many student cohorts rather than dissolving when current members graduate.</p>
<h3 id="how-sponsors-can-support-us">How Sponsors Can Support Us</h3>
<p><strong>Financial Sponsorship</strong><br>
Direct funding enables component purchases, fabrication services, and safety compliance. Sponsors can designate funds for engineering development, charitable programs, or general operations. All financial support receives appropriate recognition and transparent reporting on fund utilization.</p>
<p><strong>Component Donations and Discounts</strong><br>
Solenoid valve manufacturers, sensor suppliers, electronics companies, and materials providers can donate or discount components. This reduces cash requirements while demonstrating products in demanding aerospace applications. We document component performance in our technical reports, providing valuable product validation.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment and Facility Access</strong><br>
Local machine shops providing CNC time, aerospace companies offering fabrication assistance, or institutions granting workspace reduce operational costs significantly. In-kind support is as valuable as financial contributions and receives equivalent recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Mentorship</strong><br>
Professional engineers reviewing our designs, safety consultants evaluating test procedures, and industry experts providing guidance accelerate development while ensuring quality. Student-led projects benefit enormously from experienced mentorship that respects student autonomy while preventing costly mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="sponsorship-recognition">Sponsorship Recognition</h3>
<p>We structure partnership levels to accommodate various organizational capacities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Founding Partner ($10,000+)</strong>: Prominent logo placement, naming opportunities, recruiting access, quarterly reporting, private test event invitations</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Partner ($5,000-9,999)</strong>: Logo recognition, technical presentation participation, semi-annual reporting, public test invitations</li>
<li><strong>Community Partner ($1,000-4,999)</strong>: Website acknowledgment, newsletter subscription, annual open house invitation</li>
<li><strong>In-Kind Partners</strong>: Recognition equivalent to cash value of contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>All sponsorship agreements maintain our editorial independence—recognition is proportional to support but never compromises technical decision-making. We provide transparent reporting on fund utilization and welcome sponsor engagement through facility visits, technical discussions, and recruitment opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-sustainability">Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
<p>Student organizations need sustainable funding models that continue after founding members graduate. Beyond immediate sponsorship, we are developing revenue streams including educational propulsion kits, STEM workshops, and government grants. These future revenue sources will reduce sponsorship dependence, but near-term support is needed to build technical capability and organizational infrastructure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-impact--outcomes">7. IMPACT &amp; OUTCOMES</h2>
<h3 id="what-participating-students-gain">What Participating Students Gain</h3>
<p>Students gain hands-on experience designing, analyzing, and testing rocket engines. They apply theory to real hardware and see how engineering decisions affect performance. Work spans multiple disciplines—thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science, manufacturing, control systems—requiring understanding of how subsystems integrate. Students develop project management skills, professional documentation practices, and experience with iterative design. They learn from hardware failures and refine designs based on test results. KAL participants graduate with engineering experience beyond academic coursework.</p>
<h3 id="community-impact-through-charitable-programs">Community Impact Through Charitable Programs</h3>
<p>Our social impact pillar addresses STEM education inequality by providing equipment, knowledge, and mentorship to under-resourced schools and communities. Equipment donations (3D printers, CNC machines, electronics) enable hands-on projects previously impossible. We accompany hardware with training, documentation access, and ongoing technical consultation ensuring effective utilization. Focus on Indigenous communities and underfunded districts reflects commitment to addressing systematic barriers limiting STEM participation. Multi-year partnerships create sustained capability rather than one-time interventions—recipient schools gain not just equipment, but connection to aerospace engineering community and pathways for exceptional students to participate in KAL projects. Impact measurement tracks schools served, equipment donated, students reached, and qualitative outcomes including program sustainability and student STEM engagement.</p>
<h3 id="contribution-to-student-aerospace-community">Contribution to Student Aerospace Community</h3>
<p>All KAL technical work is openly documented and shared. Our custom calculation software, design procedures, test data, and lessons learned become resources for student rocket teams worldwide. This open knowledge approach maximizes educational value beyond our direct participants while distinguishing us from proprietary commercial efforts. Publications on our documentation website, conference presentations, and online community participation establish KAL as contributing member of student aerospace ecosystem rather than isolated project.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-risks--mitigation">8. RISKS &amp; MITIGATION</h2>
<h3 id="technical-risks">Technical Risks</h3>
<p>Liquid rocket development involves inherent uncertainties. Simulation errors could yield inadequate designs; manufacturing defects could cause hardware failures; test operations involve combustion and high-pressure propellants with inherent danger. We mitigate technical risks through multi-tool validation (cross-checking analyses with NASA CEA, RPA, ANSYS), conservative design margins accommodating uncertainty, progressive testing starting at reduced performance, prototype validation before expensive fabrication, and professional safety consultation. Our Phase 1 deliberately omits regenerative cooling to isolate combustion validation from thermal management complexity, reducing early-stage risk.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-risks">Organizational Risks</h3>
<p>Student turnover threatens project continuity as graduating members take expertise with them. Scope creep tempts feature additions before completing foundational work. Funding instability could force delays if expected sponsorships don&rsquo;t materialize. We address organizational risks through comprehensive documentation preserving institutional knowledge, overlapping participation periods ensuring knowledge transfer, clearly defined phase completion criteria preventing scope expansion, and diversified funding strategy avoiding dependence on single sources. Faculty advisors and external mentors provide continuity across student generations.</p>
<h3 id="safety-and-regulatory">Safety and Regulatory</h3>
<p>Rocket testing requires fire department coordination, liability insurance, permits, and professional safety protocols. We maintain close communication with authorities, secure necessary approvals before operations, carry appropriate insurance, and structure as recognized non-profit reducing personal liability. Professional safety consultants review procedures and observe initial tests. All operations occur at off-campus sites with emergency response coordination. These requirements are time-consuming but essential for responsible operation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="9-how-to-support-kal">9. HOW TO SUPPORT KAL</h2>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Organizations interested in partnership should contact us via <a href="http://kelvinaero.org">kelvinaero.org</a> or email. Initial conversations explore organizational priorities, budget constraints, and specific interests—whether engineering development, charitable programs, or combined support. We customize proposals based on partnership tier, detailing specific benefits, recognition, and reporting.</p>
<h3 id="site-visits">Site Visits</h3>
<p>We invite prospective sponsors to visit our workspace, meet student engineers, and review technical work directly. Site visits show students discussing engineering analysis, demonstrating prototypes, and explaining design decisions. Decision-makers can evaluate the program directly.</p>
<h3 id="partnership-process">Partnership Process</h3>
<p>Typical engagement involves: initial consultation determining appropriate involvement level, customized proposal with specific terms, legal/financial documentation establishing formal agreement, and partnership launch with announcements via our channels. We structure multi-year commitments when possible but accommodate single-year pilots allowing value assessment before larger commitments.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-formal-sponsorship">Beyond Formal Sponsorship</h3>
<p>Organizations unable to commit at defined partnership tiers can still support through smaller contributions, equipment donations, mentorship, or facility access. Every form of support advances our mission and receives appropriate acknowledgment. The aerospace community succeeds through collaboration—student organizations, educational institutions, industry partners, and community groups working together advancing both innovation and educational equity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-conclusion">10. CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Kelvin Aerospace Lab demonstrates that secondary students, given appropriate support and ambitious challenges, can conduct genuine aerospace engineering producing both educational outcomes and future technology.
