## About Us

Kelvin Aerospace Lab (KAL) is a non-profit student-led organization founded in September 2025. We are committed to providing high school students with real-world hands-on engineering experience while helping to expand STEM education.

## Our Mission

**Engineering Innovation**: We develop liquid rocket propulsion systems for education and competition, giving students experience with theory, design, simulation, manufacturing, and testing.

**STEM Accessibility**: We support schools lacking STEM programs through equipment donations, open-source software tools, particularly for underfunded districts.

## Get Involved

**For Sponsors**: We seek partnerships to accelerate development and expand our educational reach. [Contact us](mailto:kelvinaero@proton.me) to discuss financial sponsorship, component donations, facility access, or technical mentorship.

**For Students**: Join us and working on propulsion analysis, CAD design, avionics, or fabrication. Learn from real engineering challenges.

**For Educators**: Access our open-source tools and digital transcription document for your own programs. We welcome more feedback on our project.
