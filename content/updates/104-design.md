## Engine Design

After confirming the use of gaseous oxygen ethanol, regenerative cooling and pintle injectors, we decided to start the concept design. This step helps to visually demonstrate the general shape and technology.

We used Fusion 360 to build the first concept model with a regenerative cooling loop to validate how regenerative cooling could be implemented.

This model illustrates the basic operation of the regenerative cooling circuit. Low-temperature ethanol enters the annular flow divider at the end of the engine through a side pipe. It then flows through the regenerative cooling circuit inside the engine sidewall and returns to the top of the engine, entering the annular gap. Gaseous oxygen enters the engine directly through a pintle injector, where it collides with the ethanol at the opening, mixing and atomizing.

After that, the mixture is ignited and flows from the high pressure area to the low pressure area, accelerating the gas discharge through the Laval nozzle.

## Edge system design

The conceptual design of the support system and test bench equipment has also been completed. Initially, gas-fed will be used to ensure the normal operation of other equipment, and later plans to switch to electric pump-fed to achieve more precise flow control.

The image shows fuel supply via three electric valves/mass flow controllers. Manometer, flow meters, temperature sensors, and safety systems are installed at key locations. This design ensures accurate data collection and improvement, while maintaining safety. We plan to deepen these themes in our next meeting.
