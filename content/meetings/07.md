## General Discussion

The seventh meeting marked a significant milestone for the Kelvin Aerospace Laboratory. With the completion of comprehensive discussions regarding the project's core technical goals, organizational structure, and funding strategies, the team concluded that the weekly meeting format has fulfilled its initial purpose. Moving forward, the team will transition from regular weekly meetings updates to event-driven meeting  updates, where gatherings will be organized when there are significant technical achievements, major milestones reached, or critical decisions to be made.

Regular updates will continue to be shared through the project website and other communication channels, ensuring everyeveryone remain informed of progress, even when formal meetings are not scheduled.

## Transition to Progress-Based Meetings Updates

### Rationale

The primary discussions surrounding project vision, technical development strategies, component sourcing, and funding approaches have been thoroughly explored and documented across the previous six meetings. These includes:

- Technical milestones for the regenerative cooling prototype and test bench development
- Component sourcing and procurement strategies
- Funding and sponsorship outreach initiatives
- Organizational workflows and collaboration tools
- Documentation standards and project management practices

The transition from theory to practice may be slower than expected, so the team decided to only update the website with Meeting Updates for significant advancements. These includes:

- Significant technical breakthroughs or setbacks occur (e.g., simulation results validated, prototype testing completed)
- Major milestones are achieved (e.g., successful component procurement, prototype fabrication completed)
- Critical decisions need team consensus
- Funding or sponsorship opportunities require immediate discussion
- New challenges or obstacles emerge that affect the project timeline

## Next Steps

The team will monitor progress on the following key workstreams and schedule meetings as needed.

The team is confident that this transition to a progress-based meeting structure will optimize time management while maintaining the collaborative spirit and momentum that has driven the project's success thus far. All team members are encouraged to document their activities, share findings, and escalate any issues that warrant a collective discussion.
