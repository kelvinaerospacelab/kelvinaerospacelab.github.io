## General Discussion

A follow-up meeting was held the day after the first meeting. The meeting focused on in-depth discussions around achievable short-, medium-, and long-term goals, and translated the objectives, division of labor, and toolchain established in the first meeting into a more specific roadmap and timeline.

#### Roadmap and Timeline

The team has broken down long-term goals into a series of deliverable milestones, with approximate timeframes for follow-up tracking and evaluation:

1. Club Start & Early Trial

    - Phase Timeline: 2024-Present (Ongoing)

    - Goals and Content: Learn foundational skills, participate in and replicate relevant small-scale projects to gain experience. Emphasize theoretical learning and hands-on training to lay the foundation for subsequent prototypes.

2. Theoretical Learning, Popularization, and Prototyping

    - Phase Timeline: 2025 (Launch)

    - Goals and Content: Plan and implement a minimum viable product (MVP), conduct small-scale combustion/nozzle/injector testing, and simultaneously conduct educational research and documentation to ensure knowledge archival.

3. Small Engine Improvement / RCS Attempt

    - Phase Time: 2025-2026

    - Goal and Content: Based on MVP, improve component design (e.g., nozzles and pintle injectors) and conduct basic experiments with small-scale RCS (reaction control) or thrust vectoring control (TVC) to enhance understanding of system behavior.

4. Small-Medium Liquid Fuel Engines

    - Phase Time: 2026

    - Goal and Content: Develop a more complete engine, integrating gas oxygen supply/ambient ethanol, regenerative cooling, and electric pump cycles, and gradually transition to more complex propulsion system design and manufacturing processes.

5. TVC Control System Thrust Vectoring/Hover Control Implementation

    - Phase Time: 2026-2027

    - Goal and Content: Demonstrate a prototype of hover and attitude control using PID and other control algorithms, integrating the propulsion system, sensors, and control loops to form a repeatable T&C (test and control) solution.

## Technical & Project Discussions

#### Aligning Tools and Responsibilities

Members discussed using Fusion 360/CREO for CAD modeling, SimScale/OpenFOAM and Ansys for simulation verification, and KiCad/Arduino for measurement, control, and data acquisition. These tools will be assigned to team tasks and milestones.

#### Prototyping

The possibility of using sand casting for prototyping was discussed and will be investigated by the team. However, the drawbacks of this approach are that it requires post-processing on a lathe or CNC machine and does not allow for regenerative cooling.

## Next Step (Continued from the previous meeting)

- Investigate and research the software, hardware, and resources required to design, test, and manufacture liquid rocket engines.
- Improve project direction planning and specific cooperation methods, such as real-time collaboration on electronic design and CAD parts.
- Research the feasibility of the direction and prepare a report.
- Explore the possibilities of using sand casting method.
