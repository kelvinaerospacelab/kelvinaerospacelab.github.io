## General Discussion

The sixth meeting focused on consolidating progress across technical development, funding strategies, and organizational workflows. A key achievement was the establishment of a centralized Google Docs system to track component procurement estimates and sponsor outreach efforts, streamlining coordination among team members. The team reviewed challenges in simulation efforts for the regenerative cooling prototype, advanced discussions on electronics for the test bench, and explored innovative funding approaches to support the project’s goals.

## Technical & Project Discussions

#### Simulation and Prototyping

Efforts to simulate the regenerative cooling prototype using ANSYS marked a significant step in the project’s technical development. The team aimed to model fluid dynamics within the cooling channels to validate the design before physical prototyping. However, the simulations encountered issues, likely due to inaccuracies in preprocessing, such as mesh generation or boundary condition settings. These challenges necessitate further refinement to ensure reliable results. The team plans to dedicate additional time to troubleshooting, with a focus on optimizing the simulation setup to accurately reflect the prototype’s performance under operational conditions.

In parallel, preparations are underway to 3D print a PLA prototype of the regenerative cooling channels. This prototype will be tested with water to evaluate fluid flow and identify design improvements before transitioning to metal fabrication. Concerns were raised about print quality, particularly with the complexity of the model, so the decision was made to first print a regenerative cooling line for testing, followed by the injectors for incremental testing. The meeting emphasized that these attempts will help accelerate the prototype development of the kit.

- Initial ANSYS simulations for regenerative cooling prototype revealed preprocessing issues requiring further optimization.
- PLA prototype for water-based fluidity testing is in preparation, with printing scheduled to assess design viability.
- Simulation and prototyping efforts will inform iterative improvements to the cooling channel geometry.

#### Electronics and Test Bench Development

The electronics subgroup made significant strides in defining the test bench’s requirements, focusing on the integration of sensors and control systems. A preliminary Bill of Materials (BOM) was developed to outline critical components for engine control and data acquisition. The BOM includes a microcontroller with built-in microSD and real-time clock capabilities, selected for its robustness in handling data logging tasks. Sensors for measuring pressure, temperature, thrust, and propellant flow rate were prioritized, with a preference for suppliers offering reliable software libraries to simplify integration. Discussions also explored the inclusion of small OLED displays for real-time data visualization.

A key debate centered on wiring choices, with stranded wire favored for its flexibility and reduced risk of single-point failures, despite being more challenging to solder compared to solid core wire. The team also discussed the potential for wireless communication, such as a 900 MHz radio for telemetry, to enhance remote monitoring capabilities. However, open questions remain about the maximum temperature and pressure ratings for sensors, as well as task allocation for microcontrollers (e.g., separating thrust vector control from data logging). These considerations will guide the next phase of electronics development.

- Developed a preliminary BOM for test bench electronics, including microcontrollers, sensors, and displays.
- Favored stranded wire for flexibility and reliability, with ongoing evaluations of soldering feasibility.
- Exploring wireless telemetry options (e.g., 900 MHz radio) to enhance data acquisition.
- Need to define sensor specifications for maximum temperature and pressure, as well as microcontroller task allocation.

#### Component Sourcing and Cost Management

Sourcing high-quality components remains a priority to ensure safety and performance in the propulsion kit. The team identified reputable suppliers for sensors and solenoid valves, emphasizing the need for components compatible with high-pressure oxygen and ethanol environments. While cost-effective options from online marketplaces were considered, concerns about quality and lack of documentation led to a preference for established suppliers with robust support. For non-critical components, such as resistors or standard displays, lower-cost alternatives may be explored to balance the budget.

The estimated cost for solenoid valves and related components remains a significant portion of the budget, totaling approximately $400 for the initial setup. To mitigate costs, the team is exploring creative sourcing strategies, such as repurposing gasoline-rated containers for ethanol storage and modifying paintball canisters for LOx tanks. Rigid pipes were proposed as a cost-effective alternative to flexible tubes for ethanol lines, given their lower cost and sufficient durability for low-pressure applications.

- Prioritizing high-quality sensors and solenoid valves from reliable suppliers for safety and performance.
- Estimated component costs around $400, with strategies to reduce expenses through alternative sourcing.
- Proposed using rigid pipes for ethanol lines and modified paintball canisters for LOx tanks to lower costs.

## Funding and Outreach

The team made significant progress in formalizing funding strategies to support the project’s technical and educational goals. A Google Docs-based system was established to track potential sponsors and component procurement estimates, enabling better coordination and transparency. Outreach efforts focused on engaging local businesses and larger corporations with a presence in the area, with an emphasis on companies supplying 3D printing materials, tools, or aerospace components. A draft email template for sponsorship proposals was developed to streamline communication with potential partners.

To diversify funding sources, the team explored creative ideas such as selling STEM kits or hosting educational workshops, particularly during the holiday season. These initiatives aim to generate revenue while promoting STEM education in the community. Additionally, the team discussed leveraging the project’s innovative nature to attract community interest and secure sponsorships, with plans to highlight progress on the official website and through targeted social media campaigns on platforms like YouTube.

- Established a Google Docs system to manage sponsor outreach and procurement tracking.
- Drafted a sponsorship email template to engage local businesses and corporations.
- Proposed selling STEM kits and hosting workshops to fund the project and promote STEM education.

## Organizational Workflow

To improve accessibility and collaboration, the team debated the use of a shared Google Drive for internal documents, such as lists and unpublished notes, alongside the existing GitHub repository. While GitHub remains the primary platform for version control and website content (using Markdown), a shared drive was proposed to accommodate team members less familiar with GitHub workflows. This approach aims to ensure inclusivity by allowing all members to access critical resources, such as BOMs and sponsorship lists, without requiring advanced technical skills. The drive will also serve as a hub for sharing media, such as photos and videos, to support outreach efforts.

The meeting emphasized the importance of proper documentation workflows, particularly for website updates. All content intended for publication must be formatted in Markdown and tested before being pushed to GitHub to avoid errors. Plans are in place to develop a comprehensive tutorial on using GitHub, Obsidian, and Hugo to streamline contributions and maintain consistency across the project’s digital presence.

- Proposed a shared Google Drive for internal documents to improve accessibility for all team members.
- Reaffirmed GitHub as the primary platform for version control and website content, with Markdown formatting required.
